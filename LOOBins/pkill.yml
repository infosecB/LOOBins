short_description: Kill processes by name or pattern.
full_description: pkill is a Unix utility available on macOS that sends signals to processes matching a given name or pattern. While intended for legitimate process management, threat actors can abuse pkill to terminate security tools, monitoring daemons, or user applications for defense evasion. It's particularly valuable to attackers as a Living Off the Land technique that avoids bringing custom binaries onto the system.
