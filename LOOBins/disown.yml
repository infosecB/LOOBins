short_description: Prevents a process from being terminated when a shell session or terminal is closed.
full_description: `disown` is a system utility that can be utilized to persist a shell process after a terminal has been closed or a shell session has been terminated. This is accomplished by preventing a SIGHUP from being sent to the running job, and removes it from the shell jobs table. Unlike `nohup` which is used during process initialization, `disown` can be used to modify an existing process.
