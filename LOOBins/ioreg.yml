short_description: Displays a hierarchial view of the I/O Kit registry.
full_description: The I/O Kit registry (ioreg) is a useful binary that can be used to gather data such as detecting if a VM is used, getting USB device vendor names, checking if a screen is locked, etc.

example_use_cases:
- name: Use ioreg to check whether the remote macOS screen is locked.
  description: The following command will display a list of keys that contain "CGSSession". If the key "CGSSessionScreenIsLocked" is present, the screen is actively locked.
  code: ioreg -n Root -d1 -a | grep CGSSession

- name: Use ioreg to check whether the host is on a physical machine or a VM
  description: Check the output of this command (specifically the IOPlatformSerialNumber, board-id, and manufacturer fields) to check whether or not this host is in a virtual machine.

- name: Use ioreg to check USB device vendor names
  description: Grep for "USB Vendor Name" values to view USB vendor names. On virtualized hardware these values may contain the hypervisor name such as "VirtualBox". This is an additional way to check for virtualization.
